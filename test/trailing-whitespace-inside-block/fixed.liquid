When it doesn't break, it should conditionally omit the trailing space

It should omit the trailing space if it is stripped anyway
{% form %}space{%- endform %}

It should not omit the trailing space if there's trailing whitespace
{% form %}space {% endform %}
{%- form %}space {% endform -%}
{% form %}space {% endform %}

It should not omit the whitespace because of whitespace stripping outside the
tag
<p>
  {% form %}aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa {% endform -%}
  {{- value }}
</p>

It should not omit the whitespace if it is included inline in a paragraph
<p>haha{% form %}space {% endform %}haha</p>
