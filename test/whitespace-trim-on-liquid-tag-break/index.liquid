In children array,

it should not add Whitespace Trim Characters (WTC) if the liquid tag does not
break on a new line

it should add wtc if the liquid tag breaks on a new line and the previous/next
characters were not spaces.
<div>{% echo 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' %}</div>
<div>{% echo 'aaa' %}{% echo 'bbb' %} {% echo 'ccc' %} </div>

</div>
