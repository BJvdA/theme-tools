When it doesn't break, it should conditionally keep a leading space

It should not keep the leading space if there's space before the tag
{% if A %}space{% endif %}

It should not keep the leading space if it is stripped anyway
{% if A -%}space{% endif %}

It should keep the whitespace if the whitespace before the tag is stripped
{%- if A %} space{% endif -%}
{% if A %} space{% endif %}

It should keep the whitespace in this weird exception case
<p>
  {{ value -}}
  {%- if A %} aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa{% endif %}
</p>

It should keep the whitespace if it is included inline in a paragraph
<p>haha{% if A %} space{% endif %}</p>
