</div>

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

This plugin adds support for the Liquid/HTML language to Prettier.

## Can this be used in production?

Not yet. We have a list of issues we're going through before it is considered stable.

As such, **this is a developer preview of @shopify/prettier-plugin-liquid.**

## Intro

Wanted to know how hard it is [to do like the Handlebars folks](https://prettier.io/blog/2021/05/09/2.3.0.html#:~:text=The%20feature%20is,under%20the%20hood.) and make a prettier plugin for Liquid.

Our problem: Liquid is a _templating_ language. As such, its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) has no notion of what its text nodes contain.

And since [prettier](https://prettier.io/) is really a `function(ast) -> string`, you can't make pretty Liquid + HTML if the AST you have has no notion of HTML.

It's possible though:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4990691/145229362-568ab7d4-4345-42b7-8794-59f7683a88a3.mp4

(That's what this prototype does)

## How we can handle it

First, we need to make a Liquid + HTML parser that supports a stricter form of Liquid.

That is, your Liquid + HTML should form a tree. This works:

```liquid
{% for product in all_products %}
  <img
    src="{{ product.featured_image | image_url }}"
    loading="lazy"
  >
{% endfor %}
```

Since it can be represented as this tree:

![docs/liquid-html-tree.png](docs/liquid-html-tree.png)

And, when it does, we can we can turn it into something _prettier_.

## How it works

1. We make a [harc/ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm) grammar that parses the tokens of the source code. [(Link to LiquidHTML grammar.)](grammar/liquid-html.ohm)
2. From Ohm's output, we build a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST). [(Link to Grammar->CST code.)](src/parsers/liquid-html-cst.ts)
3. From the nodes in the CST, we build an AST. [(Link to CST->AST code.)](src/parsers/liquid-html-ast.ts)
4. We pass that AST to the prettier printer and output something pretty. [(Link to LiquidHTML printer)](src/printers/liquid-html-printer.ts)

## Liquid that can't be prettier

Like the Ember/Handlebars plugin, this prettier plugin only supports a _subset_ of Liquid. One that can be turned into a tree.

The most common use case that isn't supported is opening HTML tags inside a liquid if without closing it (and vice-versa):

```liquid
// not supported
{% if is_3d %}
  <product-media list=of props>
{% else %}
  <div>
{% endif %}
    content that goes in the middle
{% if is_3d %}
  </product-media>
{% else %}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

When this happens, prettier will throw the following error:

```
example.liquid[error] example.liquid: LiquidHTMLParsingError: Attempting to close LiquidTag 'if' before HtmlElement 'div' was closed
[error]   3 |   <product-media list=of props>
[error]   4 | {% else %}
[error] > 5 |   <div>
[error]     |   ^^^^^
[error] > 6 | {% endif %}
[error]     | ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[error]   7 |     content that goes in the middle
[error]   8 | {% if is_3d %}
[error]   9 |   </product-media>
```

However... We _do_ support Liquid variables as HTML tag names.

```liquid
{% liquid
  if is_3d
    assign wrapper = 'product-media'
  else
    assign wrapper = 'div'
  endif
%}
<{{ wrapper }}>
  content that goes in the middle.
</{{ wrapper }}>
```

## Things that would make this production ready

- [ ] The conditional addition of whitespace trimming modes to Liquid variables and tags when an element breaks:

  ```liquid
  Input:
    <div>{% if A %} {{ thing }} {% endif %}</div>

  Output:
    <div>
      {%- if A %}
        {{ thing }}
      {% endif -%}
    </div>
  ```

  Since there wasn't whitespace before prettier pretty-printed the code. Prettier should _never_ break existing code, so if the code splits on a new line.

  - [X] Inside `HTMLElement`s
  - [X] Inside `HTMLElement`s which contain `TextNode`s (paragraphs)
  - [ ] Inside `LiquidTag`s
  - [ ] Inside `LiquidTag`s which contain `TextNode`s (paragraphs)
  - [ ] Inside `HtmlAttributes`s
  - [ ] Inside `HtmlAttributes`s which contain `TextNode`s (paragraphs)

- [ ] Identify issues by running prettier on our themes
  - [ ] Dawn

- [ ] Elaborate `LiquidTag` syntax support
  - [ ] Potentially break on long list of arguments
- [ ] Elaborate `LiquidDrop` syntax support
  - [ ] Conditions
  - [ ] Operators
  - [ ] Pipelines
  - [ ] Arguments
- [ ] Elaborate `{% liquid %}` syntax support
  - [ ] indenting `if` tags
  - [ ] indenting `case` tags

## Things that we won't do

- Liquid + JavaScript (very hard)
- Liquid + CSS (hard)

### Reasoning

It should be a non-goal to make a great experience for JavaScript + Liquid or CSS + Liquid. Use cases like these are better served by leveraging the existing tooling from the community. If you need data provided by Liquid, all you need to do is dump it and then reference it as though it was a global object or CSS var.

```liquid
<!-- layout/theme.liquid -->
<script src="{{ 'bundle.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
<script>
  window.myThemeData = {
     dataINeed: {{ dataINeed | json }},
  }
</script>

{{ 'theme.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}
<style>
  :root {
    --theme-background-color: {{ settingBackgroundColor }};
  }
</style>
```

```javascript
// assets/bundle.js
console.log(window.myThemeData.dataINeed);
```

```css
// assets/theme.css
body {
  background-color: var(--theme-background-color);
}
```

The benefit of going this way is that you can then use all the tooling you want for CSS or JavaScript independently of Liquid. e.g. prettier plugin for both languages, write your JavaScript in TypeScript, etc.
